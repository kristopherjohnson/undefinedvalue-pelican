After spending way too much time playing <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar_hero">Guitar Hero</a></i>, it occurred to me that if I had spent the same amount of time practicing with my real guitars, I might be able to play by now.

I have collected a lot of books about rock guitar over the past 20 years, but I am getting more interested in jazz.  Can anyone recommend some good basic/intermediate books or interactive courses for learning jazz guitar?

(I'm interested in jazz keyboard as well, so related recommendations would also be welcome.)
