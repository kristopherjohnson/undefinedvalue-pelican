<p>
The two-year anniversary of my <a href="http://kristopherjohnson.blogspot.com/2005/11/private-pilot-checkride.html">private pilot checkride</a> went by recently.  This has legal significance, as a pilot is not allowed to exercise the privileges of the certificate (license) unless one has had a checkride or a flight review in the past 24 months.  So, as of the end of this month, I can't fly again until I've had a flight review.
</p>
<p>
A flight review really isn't a big deal.  You are required to spend one hour on the ground and one hour in the air with a flight instructor, who will determine whether you are still a safe pilot.  However, since I haven't flown since January, I'll need a couple of refresher lessons before my review.
</p>
<p>
I also need to renew my aviation medical certification, due to the blood-pressure medication I've recently been prescribed.  So that's another hurdle to negotiate before I can fly again.
</p>
<p>
Right now, I have no plans to go back up in the air.  I have better things to do with my time and money.  I hope that I will get back into the left seat someday, but for now, I'm content to gaze up at the sky and say "It sure would be a nice day to fly."
