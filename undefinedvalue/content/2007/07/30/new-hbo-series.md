HBO has a couple of new series that I predict will be cancelled at the end of their first season.  Maybe if more people watch them, that won't happen, so I want to do my part to bring attention to them.
</p>

<em>John from Cincinnati</em> is weird, but has the best opening credits of any series ever.  I'll watch anything that has Rebecca DeMornay in it, but this one seems special.  I don't know what's going on, but I trust that David Milch (the genius behind <em>Deadwood</em>) will eventually deliver.  I am determined to learn how to surf before I get too old.

<em>Flight of the Conchords</em> is incredibly funny.  I like how the "music videos" spontaneously arise during each episode.

Please watch them.  If you don't like them, then you and I have radically different worldviews.

<em>Update (2009/6/10): Well, I was right about John from Cincinnati: cancelled after one season. Flight of the Conchords lasted two seasons.</em>
