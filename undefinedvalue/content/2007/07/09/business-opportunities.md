<p>
Today I was presented with a business opportunity.  I know a guy who knows a guy who needs some software written, but knows nothing about software, and I know nothing about how do do what he needs done.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, I am the kind of guy who, when presented with a bunch of stuff he has no idea how to do, says "I have no idea how to do that stuff.  You should talk to somebody else."
</p>
<p>
This is why I will never be rich.  The really rich guys are the ones who say "Sure, we know how to do that," and then charge $150/hour until the client runs out of money.
