What kind of idiot gets up at 5:00 AM on a national holiday to go run six miles in the heat?  I'm that kind of idiot, and today I joined about 55,000 other such idiots in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peachtree_Road_Race">Peachtree Road Race</a>.
</p>
<p>
My goal was to run the full course, without slowing to a walk.  This goal turned out to be unrealistic.  I ran the first three miles without a problem, but then I reached "Cardiac Hill," a long uphill stretch so-named for the obvious reason, and also because there is a hospital conveniently located next to it.  About halfway up the hill, I started feeling dizzy, and I decided it was better to abandon the goal than to collapse.
</p>
<p>
After clearing the top of the hill, I set a new goal: run the remainder of the course.  That didn't work either; after a half mile or so I again started feeling queasy.
</p>
<p>
So, I set yet another goal:  walk to the five-mile marker, and then run the last 1.2-mile stretch to the finish.  I accomplished that.
</p>
<p>
I didn't really run a 10K today.  I ran a 5K and a 2K, with a 3K walk in between.  My time from start to finish was 69 minutes, 28 seconds.  I expect to do better next year.
</p>
<p>
I'm not disappointed in my performance.  This was my first time.  I don't have any steep hills in the area where I usually run, so I wasn't prepared for Cardiac Hill.  The course is tricky, because the first half is mostly downhill, giving you a false sense of optimism, and then the second half is mostly uphill.
</p>
<p>
After finishing at Piedmont Park, it is a half-hour walk to get back to the MARTA train station.  That's something they don't point out in the informational handouts.  I would have rested for a while in the park before starting the walk if I'd known.
</p>
<p>
So anyway, now I have the "coveted Peachtree Road Race t-shirt."  It makes it all worthwhile.
</p>
<p>
I was impressed with how well organized the event was.  Getting 55,000 into the starting area, lining them up, giving them water and t-shirts, and getting them back home seems to me like a major undertaking, but I never felt crowded, delayed, or unsure of where I was supposed to go and what I was supposed to do.  MARTA, the city police, the Atlanta Track Club, and other involved parties seem to really have their @#$% together for this event.
</p>
<p>
I didn't take my camera with me.  There was one shot I really wanted to take: a wide-angle shot of hundreds of runners lined up at the banks of porta-potties, taken from above the parking lot.  Maybe next year . . . .
