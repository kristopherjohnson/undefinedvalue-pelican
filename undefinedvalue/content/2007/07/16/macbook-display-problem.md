A couple of weeks ago, my Macbook's display started "flickering."  It seemed like I was getting some electromagnetic interference, so I didn't worry much at first.  But, it got progressively worse, and now the screen is unreadable.

I took it in to the local Apple Genius Bar, and they took it in for repair.  I should have it back in a week or less.

I'm glad I have a Genius Bar nearby, considering all the problems I've been having with recent Apple products.  I've been using computers for almost thirty years, but have never needed repairs or service until I bought the iMac G5 and the Macbook.
