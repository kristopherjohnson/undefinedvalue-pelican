*Kris, the production system isn't working since we installed the newest release. Can you tell us how to fix it?*

Can you send me the log files?

*No. They are too big.*

Will you let me access the system myself to see what's going wrong?

*No. Developers can't touch the production system.*

OK, can I access the test system to see if it exhibits the same behavior as the production system?

*No. The test system has been dismantled.*

Did you test the new release before putting it into production?

*No. There wasn't time.*

Did you install the server-side updates?

*No. The IT manager won't allow installation of any server updates.*

Other than installing the new version, did you keep everything else the same?

*No, we changed a few other things too. Can't remember exactly what.*

Are you sure this "new" problem never occurred with the previous release?

*No. Maybe.*

Can you roll back to the previous release?

*No. We blew away the old data after converting it to the new format.*

*Well, Kris, can you tell us how to fix it?*
