I got fed up with the complexities of the various iPhone flashlight apps I've tried, so I whipped up my own dead-simple flashlight app.

It has three buttons that control the LED on the back of the phone:

- On
- Off
- Flash (once per second)

That's it.

My hope is that keeping it as simple as possible means it will load quickly and stay resident in memory, so I can have light instantly whenever I want it. This is a lot more important to me than all the controls and "features" provided by other flashlight apps.

You may want to build your own dead-simple flashlight app, or maybe you want to see some code that controls the LED light.  The source code is on GitHub: https://github.com/kristopherjohnson/KJFlashlight
