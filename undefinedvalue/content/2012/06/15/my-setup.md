I'm a fan of [The Setup](http://usesthis.com), a website containing interviews with people about the tools they use to do their jobs. It is just "[productivity porn](http://wiki.43folders.com/index.php/Productivity_pr0n)", but I find it interesting.

As a tribute, here is my own "interview" for The Setup, using the standard four questions.  I don't expect anyone to find this interesting, but writing it up helps me think about what I'm using and why, and it will come in handy the next time I have to set up a new computer.

## Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm Kris Johnson.  I [develop software](http://careers.stackoverflow.com/kristopherjohnson) for Windows, UNIX, iOS, and Android.  I currently work as an independent contractor.  I work from home most of the time, but travel to clients' facilities as needed.

## What hardware are you using?

I have a late-2011 15-inch [MacBook Pro](http://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/), with 16 GB RAM and a 750 GB hard drive. I use a [Magic Trackpad](http://www.apple.com/magictrackpad/).  In my home office, I have a 24-inch monitor and a [Das Keyboard for Mac](http://www.daskeyboard.com/model-s-professional-for-mac/). On the road, I carry an [Apple Wireless Keyboard](http://store.apple.com/us/product/MC184LL/B).

I have an iPhone 4S and a third-generation wi-fi-only iPad.  I sometimes use an [Adonit Jot](http://adonit.net/product/jot/) stylus with the iPad. I tether my iPad to the phone when necessary, but it is rare that I am using my iPad somewhere that doesn't have wi-fi.

For testing iOS apps, I have my old iPhone 3G, iPhone 4, 4th-generation iPod Touch, and original iPad. For testing Android apps, I have a Samsung Galaxy S Captivate phone and a Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0.

I find external conversations and music to be very distracting, so when I'm working I usually wear some [Hearos earplugs](http://www.hearos.com/ear-plug-hearos) or sound-isolating earphones playing [pink noise](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colors_of_noise#Pink_noise).

In bed at night, I read on a [Kindle Fire](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kindle_Fire).

I have a Targus computer bag that I lug everything around in. 

We have a Saeco super-automatic espresso machine. I try to limit myself to ten shots of espresso per day.

## And what software?

These are my most-useful Mac OS X applications:

- [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) for iOS development
- [Eclipse](http://eclipse.org/) and the [ADT Plugin](http://developer.android.com/sdk/eclipse-adt.html) for Android development
- [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/) for web development and general text editing
- [Parallels Desktop](http://www.parallels.com/products/desktop/) for running Windows
- [Dash](http://kapeli.com/dash/) for developer reference documentation
- [SourceTree](http://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) for git (but I tend to use the git command-line tools more often than this app)
- [Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com/) for quick launching
- [Adium](http://adium.im/) for chat
- [Safari](http://www.apple.com/safari/) for web browsing
- [Soulver](http://www.acqualia.com/soulver/) for calculations
- [Pages](http://www.apple.com/iwork/pages/) for word processing
- Microsoft Office for documents that I have to share with non-Mac people
- [nvALT](http://brettterpstra.com/project/nvalt/) for personal notes
- [Moom](http://manytricks.com/moom/) for window management
- [TextExpander](http://smilesoftware.com/TextExpander/)
- [Hazel](http://www.noodlesoft.com/hazel.php) for automatically clearing out my Downloads folder once in a while

These are my most-used Windows applications:

- Visual Studio 2010 Professional
- [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) (yes, it's cross-platform)
- [PuTTY](http://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/) for Telnet/SSH
- [Wireshark](http://www.wireshark.org/) for network-related code debugging
- [AutoHotKey](http://www.autohotkey.com/download/) to remap Windows keys and mouse gestures to work more like Mac OS X

I use the [Zenburn](http://slinky.imukuppi.org/zenburn/) color scheme and [DejaVu Sans Mono](http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/ttf-bitstream-vera/1.10/) font in all my source-code editors and terminal windows.

I have [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/) and [1Password](https://agilebits.com/downloads) installed everywhere I can install them. 

I write everything in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) format when I can, because so many of the tools I use support it.

This blog and other webby things are hosted on an [Amazon EC2](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) micro instance running Ubuntu. I put as much of my code as I can on [GitHub](http://www.github.com/) and [BitBucket](http://www.bitbucket.org) so that I don't have to worry about getting to it.


## What would be your dream setup?

I'd love to have one of the new MacBook Pros with Retina display, but I need to wait until I can afford to buy an SSD that is large enough to hold Mac OS X and all my Windows virtual machines.

I'd like to have a desk that can automatically move between standing and sitting height.

I'd like to have my own helicopter for commuting between my home and clients' facilities.

I wish I still had my Macintosh SE.
