Here's another programming-language cheatsheet. It's been a couple of years since I've done any Python programming, and now I'm taking the online [CS373: Programming a Robotic Car](http://www.udacity.com/) course, which uses Python for quizzes and homework assignments, so I have to get back up to speed.

As always, this is the information I've found useful in reacquainting myself with a programming language. It may not help you at all.
