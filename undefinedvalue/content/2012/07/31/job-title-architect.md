*What follows is from an actual job opportunity that was presented to me. It has been edited for brevity and to remove identifying information. I also cleaned up typos and broken grammar (recruiters apparently never read these things before sending them to candidates).*

**Job Title:** Architect

**Responsibilities:**

- Drive Solution Architectures for high performance and very highly scalable platforms.
- Collaborate with key Telecommunication Architecture on definition of delivery of solution.
- Participate in Joint Application Design/Requirements sessions
- Create and present PowerPoints to leadership describing architectural approaches and solutions

**Seeking Enterprise Architecture related type candidates. Not seeking a candidate with developer, project manager, or solution architect experience.**

**Skills & Experience Needed:**

- **UML 2** 3-5 years Required
- **Visio** 5 years Required
- **MS Word** 5 years Required
- **Agile Methodology** Intermediate Desired

*Note what is not required of an Architect: Any knowledge of how to actually produce working software. All you need to know is how to use Visio and PowerPoint.*
