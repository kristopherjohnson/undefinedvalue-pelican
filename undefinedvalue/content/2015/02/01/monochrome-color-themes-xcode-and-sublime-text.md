A lot of programmers like brightly colored syntax-highlighting themes for their source code editors. I do not. I find colorful high-contrast themes to be fatiguing, distracting, and annoying, so I've gravitated toward low-contrast themes like [Zenburn](http://kippura.org/zenburnpage/) and [Havenjark](http://eclipsecolorthemes.org/?view=theme&id=25). But even those feel too "busy" for me.

I've been on a retrocomputing kick lately, and I've missed the clean look of source code on the monochrome monitors I used in the good old days. So I've created some monochrome Xcode themes. If you like them, you can download them from here:

- <http://kristopherjohnson.github.io/MonochromeXcode/>

and copy them to your `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/FontAndColorThemes` directory, and then select them from the *Xcode &rarr; Preferences &rarr; Fonts & Colors* window.

These themes are also available as Sublime Text color schemes:

- <http://kristopherjohnson.github.io/MonochromeSublimeText/>

These were my simple rules for creating the themes:

- All colors have the same hue. They differ only in saturation and brightness.
- Comments are dim.
- Keywords are dim, but not as dim as comments.
- Numeric and string constants are bright, almost white.
- Other textual elements all have the same color.

I use [Source Code Pro Light](http://adobe-fonts.github.io/source-code-pro/) as my font, as I like the way the thin lines give a vector-graphics look.
