A few months ago, I signed up for the [Chickamauga Battlefield Marathon](http://www.battlefieldmarathon.com), which will take place this Saturday (November 14). I thought I would have adequate time to train, but it hasn't worked out that way. I ran a half marathon last week, with a time of 2:30 (not great) and in my longer training runs over the past month, I've found that after mile 12, I have to do a lot of walking.

So I've canceled my hotel reservations and will not be running that marathon this weekend. Instead, I've decided I will concentrate on the half-marathon distance. When I get that down to around 2 hours, I'll start thinking about a full marathon again.
