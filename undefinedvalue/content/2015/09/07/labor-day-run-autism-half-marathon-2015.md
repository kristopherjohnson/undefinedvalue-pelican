Today I ran the "Labor Day Run for Autism Half Marathon" at Fowler Park/Big Creek Greenway.

My time was 2:37. Not as good as I had expected. I was hoping for a time in the 2:20-2:30 range. I ran out of gas around mile 9, and walked a lot of the last few miles.

But, the November marathon for which I'm training still seems doable.
