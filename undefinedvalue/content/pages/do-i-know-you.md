Title: Do I Know You?

If you are reading this, it is probably because you are a stranger who sent me a message that I consider to be rude, insulting, or otherwise inappropriate.

If you want to talk to someone you don't know, the polite thing is to first introduce yourself in a friendly way and let the other person know that you would like to have a conversation.  I am open to others' opinions and points of view, but I am not going to waste my time responding to people who just attack others on the Internet.

If I have written or shared something that you find offensive, please consider that maybe [it wasn't directed at you](everything-on-the-internet-is-not-directed-at-you.html).  Maybe I was just having a bad day.  I'm sorry.  I really don't mean to offend anybody.  If you think I've written something awful, I would like to know what I did wrong.

If the only thing you have to tell me is that I am a fool, full of shit, a horse's ass, un-American, intolerant, hypocritical, self-righteous, Socialist, or Communist, please understand I am already aware of these facts.  You are wasting your time repeating them.

I am really a pretty nice guy.  I work hard.  I have five dogs.  I like old movies and bourbon.  I play guitar badly.  Please don't hate me just because I posted something you don't like.  I'd be glad to get to know you, but only if you can be nice.
