Title: Do I Know You?

If you are reading this, it is probably because you are a stranger who sent me a message that I consider to be rude, insulting, or otherwise inappropriate.

If you want to have a conversation with someone you don't know, the polite thing is to first introduce yourself in a friendly and let the other person know that you would like to have a conversation.  I am open to listening to others' opinions and points of view, but I am not going to waste my time responding to people who just hurl insults.

If I have written or shared something that you find offensive, please consider that maybe [it wasn't directed at you](/everything-on-the-internet-is-not-directed-at-you.html).  Maybe I was just having a bad day.  I'm sorry.  I really don't mean to offend anybody.  If you think I've written something awful, I would like to know what I did wrong.

If the only thing you have to tell me is that I am a fool, full of shit, a horse's ass, un-American, intolerant, hypocritical, self-righteous, Socialist, or Communist, please understand I am already aware of these facts.  You are wasting your time repeating them.

I am probably a nicer guy than whoever you pictured when you saw that post that made you mad.  I'm a middle-aged guy who wishes he was younger.  I love my five dogs.  I like old movies and bourbon.  I play guitar badly.  I ran a marathon a few years ago, and want to do it again.  Please don't hate me just because I posted something you don't like.

If I've misjudged your intent, I'm sorry.  I'd be glad to get to know you and hear what you have to say, but only if you can be nice.
