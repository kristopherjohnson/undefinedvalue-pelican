So, I've deactivated my Facebook and Twitter accounts. Good bye, and good riddance.

I will miss the people I've talked to on those services, but it's time to sever my connections with those services.  Those services are evil, and nobody should be providing "content" to them.

I don't know yet how I will get the information that I got from those services.  I'll figure out something.  In the meantime, I think I will be glad to not need to worry about it.
