When you turn 50, they make you get a [colonoscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonoscopy). That doesn't seem fair.

But it really isn't too bad.  The worst part is the "prep", which is a euphemistic way of saying "Spend a day on a clear-liquid diet, take a bunch of laxatives, then spend a few hours in or near the restroom."

One is anesthetized for the procedure.  I remember the anesthesiologist asking the doctor "Should I put him to sleep now?" and the next thing I remember is waking up in the recovery room.  After a meal and a long nap at home, it's like nothing ever happened.

So now I'm part of the colonoscopy club, but I don't plan to attend another meeting until I'm 60.
