After the Charlottesville incident this weekend, it is easy to denounce "Nazis" and "white supremacists", and think you're on the good side of things. That is missing the bigger picture.

White supremacy has been ingrained in American culture for centuries, before the Confederacy or the Nazis existed. Most white nationalists don't attend rallies or fly Confederate flags or tattoo swastikas on their bodies or salute Hitler. They are your family, your friends, your coworkers. They are us.

Most white people think "Racism is terrible, but I'm not a racist, and my friends and family aren't racists, so it's not my fault and there is nothing I can do about it." But that's not true. The US is a racist society, and white people are complicit in the maintenance of white supremacy.

We live in an unfair and unjust society. We are all responsible for fixing it, even if we consider ourselves blameless. We won't fix this by pointing our fingers at "racists" and blaming them. We all have work to do.

Go ahead and make fun of the tiki-torch terrorists in Virginia if you must, but if you really care about justice, do what you can to tear down white supremacy where you can. Stop treating racism as somebody else's problem. Stop claiming white males face oppression. Stop laughing at racist jokes. Stop spreading lies about affirmative action. Stop excusing police brutality by saying they have a hard job. Confront your friends and relatives when they say awful things in private. Ask employers why they don't hire and promote more black people. Ask politicians what they are doing, and demand that they do more. March alongside people who should be treated as equals.

As Martin Luther King, Jr. said in "Letter from Birmingham Jail", the real roadblock to progress is not the avowed racist; it is the "white moderate" who claims to want justice but wants change to be easy and gradual. We owe it to our fellow citizens to make things better now, without regard for how hard it might be for us.
