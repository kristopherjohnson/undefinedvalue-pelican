[Episode #45](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2013/03/podcast-45-keeping-it-sharp/) of the Stack&nbsp;Exchange podcast featured [Eric&nbsp;Lippert](http://ericlippert.com), who got some great advice from his first manager at Microsoft:

> I want you to be a recognized industry expert on something. ... But don't pick something that's too big. ... Find a source of questions, answer every question that you know the answer to that is in that domain, and if there is a question that you not know the answer to, make it your business to find out.

This is why Eric Lippert [answers so many Stack Overflow questions](http://stackoverflow.com/users/88656/eric-lippert). 

This is why *everyone* should be answering more questions and sharing their expertise. It makes you better at what you do.
