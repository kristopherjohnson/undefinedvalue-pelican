After years of using [curl](http://curl.haxx.se) to test web interfaces, like cavemen did, I've finally started using more sophisticated tools.

There are a couple of applications for Google Chrome that I like:

- [Postman](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman-rest-client/fdmmgilgnpjigdojojpjoooidkmcomcm)
- [Advanced Rest Client](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/advanced-rest-client/hgmloofddffdnphfgcellkdfbfbjeloo?hl=en)

They have similar feature sets. Postman is prettier and a bit easier to use, but Advanced Rest Client makes it easier to manipulate the response data.
