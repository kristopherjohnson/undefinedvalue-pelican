The MSDN feed indicates that there are several new walkthroughs
available today:

-   Build a Data-Driven Website Using Visual Basic .NET and Visual Studio .NET 2003
-   Build a Data-Driven Website Using Visual C# .NET and Visual Studio .NET 2003
-   Build a Data-Driven Website Using Visual Basic .NET and ASP.NET Web Matrix
-   Build a Data-Driven Website Using Visual C# .NET and ASP.NET Web Matrix
-   Build a Data-Driven Website Using Visual C# .NET and the .NET Framework SDK

I haven't looked at these articles, but I assume they contain the same
information, except some are in C# and some are in VB.NET, and some use
Visual Studio .NET and the others use different tools. At first I
wondered why there is not a "Build a Data-Driven Website Using Visual
Basic .NET and the .NET Framework SDK" (the one missing combination),
but then I realized that VB .NET developers are assumed to be incapable
of using command-line tools.

At first I was pissed off at the MSDN folks for once again promulgating
the belief that VB .NET programmers can't read C# (and vice versa), or
that a Web Matrix programmer won't be able to figure out which menu
items to use to create an application, having only been led step-by-step
through the Visual Studio process. But of course, the MSDN folks have to
do this because *there really are* a lot of developers who are unable or
unwilling to make sense out of code that is not in the one language they
know, or who don't know their tools well enough to use them after being
shown a demonstration with a similar tool.

I have some sympathy when a C programmer has trouble reading Haskell, or
a Fortran programmer has trouble reading Prolog. But C\# and VB.NET are
essentially the same language, with some minor syntactical differences.
If you know one of those languages, you should have no problem reading
the other unless you are either incredibly stupid or incredibly
closed-minded. If you can't figure out that a "project" in one IDE is
like a "solution" in another IDE, then please find another career so I
won't risk running into you someday.

If you are learning .NET, you should be able to read C\#, VB.NET, and
JScript.NET with equal facility. C programmers and C++ programmers
should have no trouble reading one anothers' code, nor should Lisp and
Scheme programmers, or Smalltalk and Ruby programmers. If you are
unwilling to learn even a little about things at the boundaries of your
existing knowledge, you have no business calling yourself a professional
or being proud of your skills, no matter what field you are in.

I look forward to the day when MSDN could publish an article called
"Build a Data-Driven Website Using .NET", without the need to focus on
specific languages or specific tools. I know that day will never come,
so I'll have to settle for finding colleagues who would be capable of
understanding such an article.
