Why do they keep doing this to me? I was just minding my own business,
writing buggy software more slowly than expected. But they've made me a
manager again. I'm the "lead engineer" on a "highly visible" project.
It's a "great opportunity", generating "a lot of excitement" in upper
management levels. It "could lead to other things".

Time to start looking for another job, I guess.
