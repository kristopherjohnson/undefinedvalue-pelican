I just ordered Microsoft Office Professional for the Mac. I feel a
little dirty.

I was hoping that the Mac could be a Microsoft-free haven for me. Then I
found that I needed Windows Media Player, so I got that. Then I needed
Microsoft Remote Desktop Connection, so I got that. Then I needed MSN
Messenger. But those were "free", so I consoled myself by thinking that
at least I wasn't giving any more money to Microsoft.

Unfortunately, I can't find a good substitute for Microsoft Office.
OpenOffice for Mac is uglier than any Windows application I've ever
seen. AppleWorks feels like a toy, and can't read Office file formats.
When I brought work home, I wanted to use the Mac, but couldn't.

What finally drew me in was the announcement that Virtual PC 7 would be
included in MS Office Pro. I don't really need to run Windows on my Mac,
but I would like to try out Linux distros and other operating systems.

The last Office version I bought was Office 98 for Windows. That
qualifies me for the upgrade price, so I'm getting Virtual PC and the
rest of Office for a little under $300. That's a pretty good deal in
the Windows world. And maybe it won't suck quite as much on a Mac.
