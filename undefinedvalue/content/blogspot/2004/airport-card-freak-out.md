Last night, for no apparent reason, I suddenly lost the WiFi connection
on the iMac. I was unable to access the Internet or the other machines
on my home network. Every attempt to reconnect to the network gave me an
error message. My other laptop with WiFi was working fine, so I assumed
it must be an iMac problem, but I tried re-booting the wireless router
anyway. No help.

So I re-booted the Mac, hoping that would fix it. Nope: still unable to
connect.

I tried re-booting a couple more times, along with various other acts of
desperation. What finally fixed it was a full shutdown and restart.
After that, everything was fine.

I'm finding that I have to reboot or shutdown-and-restart my iMac a lot
more often than I do with my Windows box. I'm hoping that trend will
change once I get through the initial shakedown period.
