We've reached our deadline, and spent our entire budget. So I'd like to
congratulate everyone on the successful completion of the project.

Unfortunately, we aren't finished. I estimate that we have another 4-6
weeks of work to do, which means we really probably have 8-12 weeks of
work to do.

Let the recriminations begin!
