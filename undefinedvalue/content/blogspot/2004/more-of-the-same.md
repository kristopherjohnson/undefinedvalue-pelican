In *Citizen Kane*, there is a scene where Kane's newspaper staff is
deciding what headline to run on election day after Kane's run for the
governorship. Had Kane won, the headline would have been "KANE WINS!".
However, he didn't win, so the headline they use is "FRAUD AT POLLS!".

I spent most of my time watching PBS's *NewsHour* coverage of the
election returns, but I jumped around to the other networks. When Ohio
was called for Bush by NBC, apparently sewing things up for Bush, the
commentators started admitting that they were surprised. Early exit
polls had shown a likely Kerry win. Most of the journalists thought it
they'd be projecting a Kerry win early in the evening. They told us none
of this until after Bush had apparently won. I suppose it's a good thing
that they didn't report on the what they thought the outcome would be
while it was going on, but it makes me wonder what else journalists know
that they won't tell us.

C-SPAN's [election map](http://network.ap.org/dynamic/files/specials/election_night_2004/us_map_govsenhouse/index.html?SITE=CSPANELN&SECTION=POLITICS&reload=true) is pretty cool. I heard that on CNN.com, one can find the data on
election returns for each precinct/county. I'm not sure how "useful" any
of this data is, but political information junkies must be thrilled with
what they can get on the Internet these days.

My favorite election news story of the day was [this one](http://www.netcrucible.com/blog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=600db7be-39a9-4163-ac0c-0e8a8139dc3b).
