I was an early Macintosh user. I bought my first Mac in college
(actually, my parents bought it), around 1987. It was a Mac SE, with 1MB
of RAM and a 20 MB hard drive. A few years later, I got a IIsi, and a
few years after that, I bought one of the initial PowerMacs.

Like the average Mac user, I couldn't understand why anyone would settle
for an MS-DOS-based PC. The Mac was clearly superior, in every way.

For me, that attitude started changing soon after Windows 95 appeared.
Flawed as it was, Windows 95 was an operating system with pre-emptive
multi-threading and protected memory spaces. Mac OS 7, while sporting a
better user interface, had an obsolete kernel, and Apple wasn't doing
anything about it. I stuck with the Mac for a while, but was no longer
sure of its superiority. When I started using NT 4 heavily at work, my
disenchantment with Mac OS grew. I finally gave up on the Mac in the
late 90's, buying a PC and putting Windows 98 on it.

So, for the past few years, I've been a Windows guy. I've watched
Apple's ups and downs. I was glad when they ditched their old OS in
favor of the NeXT-derived stuff, but by that time I had amassed enough
Windows software and experience that there was no strong reason to
switch back. I had lost all the emotional attachment that the original
Mac had engendered.

But last week, I saw the new iMac, and was immediately interested. It is
so simple and elegant. So I ordered one of the 20" models. It should be
here in early October.

This is the first time a computer has been an "impulse buy". I bought it
because it was cool, not because I have any real need for it. I'm still
not sure what I'll do with it. I don't plan to write software for it. I
probably won't play any games on it. I plan to just stick it on a small
desk in my living room, and use it to read e-mail or browse the web, and
maybe do some digital photo or music editing.

My iMac will just be a little computing sanctuary where Microsoft can't
touch me.
