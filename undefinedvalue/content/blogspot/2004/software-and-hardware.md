Charles Miller had an [amusing blog entry](http://fishbowl.pastiche.org/2004/01/14/blood_sacrifice) about
the hazards of computers. I am currently working with development of
embedded systems software, so I spend a lot of my day plugging and
unplugging PCI cards, comm ports, etc. My hands are covered with little
scratches, cuts, and punctures.

Computer programming is supposed to be a cushy intellectual job, but
it's amazing how much physical labor and torment programmers go through.
RSI and sore backs are common. Electric shocks are common as well. We
have to crawl around on floors to figure out which cable is connected to
what. We've all over-strained ourselves carrying around big CRTs and
servers. Many of us have had equipment racks fall on top of us.
Incidents like these stress the importance of the first syllable of
*hardware*.

I've heard that there are some programmers who never have to deal with
hardware. The computer is off in some other room somewhere, and it is
someone else's job to keep it running. Somebody else installs the device
drivers, and configures the networks, and connects the keyboards and the
monitors. I've always felt that these programmers are somewhat like the
ivory-tower academics who never have to deal with the reality of
computers. Without playing with the hardware, how can one really
appreciate what the software does?
