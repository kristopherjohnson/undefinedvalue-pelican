I remember, when I was young and foolish, that I was always excited at
the beginning of a new project. I saw the opportunity to create
something new and perfect. I expected to learn new things with new
friends. I was always optimistic.

Now things are much different. When a new project starts, I notice the
lack of focus and of a unified vision. I see the counter-productive
agendas of the stakeholders. I wonder if the people I'm working with
know what they are doing. I see people setting one another up to take
the fall when things go badly.

Am I too jaded and cynical, or just realistic? I don't know. But I do
know that I dread new projects. I don't think it is fear of the unknown
causing my dread; I think it is recognition of bad things I've seen
before and expectation that history will repeat itself.

Ignorance is bliss.
