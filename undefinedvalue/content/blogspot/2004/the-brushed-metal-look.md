I was going to blog about what I think about the mixture of the "brushed
metal" look and the more traditional Apple look in Mac OS X, but someone
else already wrote everything I wanted to say:
<http://daringfireball.net/2004/10/brushedmetal>.

The Finder is especially annoying in that it switches itself between
brushed metal and plain-old-window depending on whether you show or hide
the toolbar. With the Apple Human Interface Guidelines encouraging
developers to look to the Finder as an example of correct UI design,
it's not surprising that people can't agree on the appropriateness of
the brushed-metal look or on many other aspects of how a "real Macintosh
application" should work.

I don't understand why Apple wants its applications to look like a bunch
of overpriced components for audiophiles.
