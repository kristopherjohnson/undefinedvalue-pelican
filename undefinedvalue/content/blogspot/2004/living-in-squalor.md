A few weeks ago, after watching the film *Supersize Me!*, I stopped
eating fast food. I was preparing my own meals, using fresh ingredients.
I felt better, lost some excess weight, and had more energy.
Unfortunately, with the long hours and stress at work recently, I've
returned to the old two-value-meals-a-day diet. I don't have time to
shop or cook, and that fast food tastes really, really good.

This means I now bring home a couple of fast-food bags per day, along
with all the excess packaging. My trash can at home is pretty small, so
I developed the habit of stacking the fast food bags neatly next to it.
Every few days (when I remember) I put all the trash in a bag and haul
it out to the dumpster.

It seemed like typical bachelor behavior. But this morning, while going
into the kitchen to make coffee (another habit I thought I'd broken), it
hit me: I've got *garbage piled up in my home*!

Ewww.
