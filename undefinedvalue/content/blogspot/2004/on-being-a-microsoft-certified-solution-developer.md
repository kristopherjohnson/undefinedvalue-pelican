I earned the Microsoft Certified Solution Developer for .NET
certification last year. My resum√© is mired in C++ and CORBA, and I
wanted something that would indicate to potential employers that I could
do something else. I missed out on the Java bandwagon, and couldn't
compete with the junior Java developers with 3+ years experience who
would work for $25/hour. So I thought being an MCSD might get me in
early on .NET development.

The tests weren't the cakewalk that I had been led to believe by the
detractors of Microsoft's certification program. I agree that the tests
don't provide a good indication of whether a candidate would be a good
developer, but they do indicate that the candidate has an encyclopedic
knowledge of the .NET API and the features of Visual Studio .NET.

The architecture exam, usually considered to be the toughest of the MCSD
exams, was the easiest one for me. It was the one exam where careful
reading and common sense would get you through, rather than a lot of
rote memorization.

Getting the MCSD didn't help me much in getting a job. I suspect it is
actually considered a black mark by those who believe anyone taking
Microsoft's tests must be a clueless, mindless drone.

I think that studying for the exams did help me to learn some things
about .NET that I would not have learned otherwise. The exam guides gave
me a plan for learning .NET, rather than just stumbling around randomly.
So that is what is of most value to me: the learning, not the piece of
paper.
