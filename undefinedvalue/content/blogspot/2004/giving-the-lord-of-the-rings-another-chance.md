I didn't like *The Lord of the Rings* when I read it as a teenager. I
loved *The Hobbit*, but *Rings* just bored me. It had too much singing
and story-telling, and was just too long. I lost interest before
finishing the first volume, so the other two volumes were a long slog. I
had to read it because of peer pressure (I got tired of hearing "What,
you haven't read the *Rings* trilogy?"), but it was a lot like reading
books my teachers assigned.

After seeing the three *Rings* films, I am ready to give the books
another chance. The films were entertaining, and have given me enough
knowledge of the story and characters that I can read the books without
losing interest. I hope to enjoy all the stuff that didn't make it into
the movies, and to be able to say something intelligent when I get
trapped in one of those stupid "The movie wasn't like the book"
conversations.

Who knows? If this works out, maybe I'll give that horrible *Dune*
series another chance as well.
