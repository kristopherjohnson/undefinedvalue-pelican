For most of my adult life, I didn't really have any "hobbies". I spent
most of my free time watching TV, reading books, hanging out with
friends, or improving my programming skills. I didn't consider any of
these activities to be hobbies, and always wondered if I was missing out
on the fun others had with their hobbies.

A couple of years ago, when I quit my job to take time off work, I made
an effort to develop some hobbies. I took sailing lessons, and joined
the local sailing club. I got into digital photography, taking pictures
of my young nieces and messing around with the pictures in Photoshop. I
tried creating music using Cakewalk's SONAR digital audio production
product.

I didn't really stick with any of those hobbies, but they were fun and
led me to try some other things:

-   home-brew beer
-   self-taught piano lessons
-   juggling
-   RC helicopters
-   electronics

I came pretty close to getting into aquariums a couple of weeks ago. I
was going to create a mini-reef marine aquarium, one of the most
difficult to maintain. After reading a couple of books, I finally
decided against it. The helicopter hobby is pretty expensive, and this
marine aquarium thing looked like it could be even worse. So I've
decided to put it off until I buy a house or until I give up the
helicopters.

One concern about my choice of hobbies is that none of them involve
other people. Sure, I "chat" with other hobbyists online who share these
hobbies, but I never actually interact with anyone. I need to find
something that interests me that will get me into groups of people.

All these hobbies are really cutting into my TV-watching time. And one
of these days, I may need to re-classify house-cleaning as a hobby so
that I can find time to do that.
