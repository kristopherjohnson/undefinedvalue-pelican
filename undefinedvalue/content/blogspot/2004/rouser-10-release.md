I don't know if anyone is interested, but my simple Rouser alarm clock
application is available for download from here:
<http://kristopherjohnson.net/download/Rouser-1.0.dmg>. Source code is
included, and it's all free under an MIT-style license.

It mostly works. The Print and Help commands don't work. OS X 10.3
(Panther) is required; I don't know what it will do (if anything) under
older OS X versions.

For the next version, I plan to provide the following:

-   a better application icon
-   a help file
-   preferences/options settings
-   AppleScript support

If you try it out, please let me know what you think.
