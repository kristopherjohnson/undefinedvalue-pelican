My name is Kris Johnson. For eleven years, I have been a computer
programmer. For the first few years, I enjoyed it. Now, I've grown tired
of it, but I don't have any other marketable skills and I don't want to
move into management. So, I do what I can to improve my programming
skills in the hope that I can work less hard. I also like to exchange
ideas with others about how to make the programmer's life easier.

Writing is a great outlet for me. It helps me focus my thinking, and
gives me a way to vent my frustrations. I also like to think that others
benefit from reading what I write (although I've seen no evidence of
that). For a while, I interacted with the community at the [C2
wiki](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki) (a.k.a., "Ward's Wiki"). I learned quite a
bit there. But that community has changed, and I don't think my writings
will fit there anymore, so from now on I'll write here.

To avoid trouble, I'm going to refrain from writing about my current
job. If I do write about my job, it will be disguised so much that
nobody will know. However, most if not all of what I write will be about
what I've learned about software development, and about what I still
hope to learn.

I may also occasionally post an "off-topic" item such as a movie or book
review, or just some odd thought I had while eating breakfast. But don't
worry; I don't have that many thoughts.
