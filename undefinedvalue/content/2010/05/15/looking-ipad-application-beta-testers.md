Some time in the next few weeks, I hope to have an iPad game ready for submission to the App Store. I am looking for people to help me test the app.

You need to have the following:

- An iPad
- Somebody with whom to play the game (it's a two-player game, but you only need one iPad)

To be a beta tester, you will have to give me your iPad's UDID (unique device identifier). To get that, follow these steps:

0. Launch iTunes on your computer
0. Plug your iPad into the USB port and wait for iTunes to indicate it is connected
0. Select your iPad in the Devices list in iTunes and click the Summary tab
0. Click the word "Serial Number" next to the picture of your iPad. It will change to "Identifier (UDID)" and there will be a long string of letters and digits after it
0. From the Edit menu, choose the Copy command. (This will copy the letters and digits to the clipboard.)
0. Paste the UDID into an email to me, saying that you want to be a beta tester. If you don't know my email address, use the [Contact Me](http://undefinedvalue.com/contact) form.
