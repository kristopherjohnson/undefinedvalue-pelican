I just finished watching *[Objectified](http://www.objectifiedfilm.com/)*, and can wholeheartedly recommend it to audiences of all ages.

*Objectified* is about industrial designers. Those are the people who design all the stuff we buy. Look around you: that desk you're sitting at was *designed* by *somebody*. The mouse and keyboard were designed by somebody. That lamp was designed by somebody. The chair you're sitting in was designed by somebody.

We often think that consumerism and mass production takes the human element out of life, but *Objectified* will make you look at all those little works of art that surround us. Sure, there may be ten million copies of each thing, made by people in sweatshops, but somewhere there was a person who thought about it and made a lot of decisions. What shape should it be? What color should it be? What texture should it have? Should the edges be sharp or rounded? What should it be made of? How will it be manufactured? How much will people pay for it? What should the packaging look like? How can it be disposed of?

*Objectified* presents interviews with the people who do that. It may be a little geeky (how many people really care?), but it will give you a new appreciation for all that stuff you buy.

I rented it from iTunes. Next I'm going to watch *[Helvetica](http://www.helveticafilm.com/)*, which was directed by the same guy.
