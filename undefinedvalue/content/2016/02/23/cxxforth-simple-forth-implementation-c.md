Because implementing obsolete programming languages is a great use of my free time, I've created [cxxforth][cxxforth], an implementation of [Forth][forth] in [C++][c++].

Inspired by [JONESFORTH][jonesforth], I wrote it in the style of a tutorial. The source code is automatically converted to a pretty-printed format: <https://github.com/kristopherjohnson/cxxforth/blob/master/cxxforth.cpp.md>.

Now, on to the next waste of my time...
