As an experiment in using Apple's new [Swift programming language](https://developer.apple.com/swift/), I whipped up a simple tip-calculator app for iOS&nbsp;8.

Yes, the world really needs _Yet Another Tip Calculator_, and it also really needs _Yet Another Swift App Example_.

In addition to using Swift, the app also uses an embedded framework, which is a new feature of iOS&nbsp;8. The framework contains functions and classes for converting between numbers and text, and it might be useful in other apps.

If you actually want to use this app, you'll have to build it yourself. But if you have iOS&nbsp;8 on your phone now, you should know how to do that.
