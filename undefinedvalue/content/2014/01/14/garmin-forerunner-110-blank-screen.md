I recently purchased a [Garmin Forerunner 110](http://www.amazon.com/Garmin-Forerunner-GPS-Enabled-Sport-Monitor/dp/B003JTLKIA/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1389711829&sr=1-1&keywords=garmin+forerunner+110+red) GPS watch to track my runs. I've been happy with it, but today when I plugged it into my computer after a run, the watch screen flashed "Saving activity" and then went blank. The watch was dead after that.

It had been fully charged before my run, so I was pretty sure it wasn't just out of juice. The instructions provided with the watch weren't helpful.

This blank-screen issue appears to be a common problem. The [Forerunner 110 Blank Screen (Dead)](https://forums.garmin.com/showthread.php?10639-Forerunner-110-Blank-Screen-(Dead)) thread in the Garmin forums has over 100 entries. You can browse that thread for details, but here is a summary of the suggested fixes:

- Hold down the Light, Start/Stop, and Lap/Reset buttons for about 30 seconds. (This worked for me.)
- Hold down all four buttons for about 7 seconds. (Didn't work for me.)
- Hold down the Light button for about 6 seconds. (Didn't work for me.)
- Hold down the "Power" button while plugging it into the computer. (My watch doesn't have a button labeled "Power". I tried this with the Light button, and with the Page/Menu button, but neither worked.)
- Plug it into a different USB port. (Didn't work for me.)
- Just leave it plugged in for a few days, and eventually it will spring back to life.
- Rub the contacts with a pencil eraser.
- Attach the USB clip, but don't attach the clip to a USB port, and hold the Light button for 6 seconds.
- Check whether there is a [firmware update](http://connect.garmin.com/firmware) available.
- Try a [master reset](http://support.garmin.com/support/searchSupport/case.faces?caseId=%7B0439fb90-a761-11e0-d01c-000000000000%7D).
- Contact Garmin Customer Support.
- Take the watch back to where you bought it for replacement/refund.

After I got it working, i checked for a [firmware update](http://connect.garmin.com/firmware), and indeed there was a new firmware version available for the Forerunner 110. This is in the release notes:

> Changes from version 2.60 to version 2.70:
>
> Fixed an issue where the device could display a blank screen while connected to the charger.

I installed the update. I'll have to wait to see whether the problem recurs.

**Update 2014-01-23:** The screen went blank again. Hold down the Light, Start/Stop, and Lap/Reset buttons got it working.

**Update 2014-03-09:** Blank again, and the above remedies weren't working. The recharging display did appear when I connect it to USB, but it wouldn't do anything when disconnected. I let it sit disconnected for a few hours, and it sprung to life.
