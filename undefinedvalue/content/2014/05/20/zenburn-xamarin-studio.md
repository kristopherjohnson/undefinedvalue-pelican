I've been playing around with [Xamarin](http://xamarin.com). Its IDE, Xamarin Studio, comes with a bunch of (IMHO) terrible color schemes, so I ported [Zenburn](http://slinky.imukuppi.org/zenburnpage/) to the Xamarin format.

You can find my Zenburn for Xamarin theme here: https://gist.github.com/kristopherjohnson/784360f9676b59766678

To use it, download the `.json` file, open Xamarin Studio, go to **Preferences > Syntax Highlighting**, click the **Add** button, and select the file. 

It's not a complete rendition of Zenburn. I've only defined the colors that are used in C# and F# code, and haven't bothered with all of the subtle color distinctions between different varieties of syntax elements.
