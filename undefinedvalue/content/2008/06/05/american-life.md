<p>
<em><a href="http://thisamericanlife.org/">This American Life</a></em> has become my favorite podcast.  Each week, they choose a theme and have three little stories about that theme. The "stories" are usually interviews or monologues.  Occasionally they will do a single long story.

The host's voice annoyed me at first. After a few shows, though, I now look forward to hearing it.

<p>
There is also a TV series on Showtime. I like it, but prefer the audio podcast.

<p>
<em>This American Life</em> is produced by Chicago Public Radio. If you like the show as much as I do, send 'em a few bucks.
