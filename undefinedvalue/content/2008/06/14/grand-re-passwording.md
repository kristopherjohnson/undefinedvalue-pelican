I have a dirty little secret: I have used the same password for my web site accounts for a very long time.  Yahoo!, Google, Hotmail, Amazon, all of them &mdash; same password, unchanged for years.  I've always known this was a bad idea, but I didn't want the trouble of creating unique passwords and changing them periodically.
</p>
<p>
That has changed. After hearing the description of <a href="http://passwordmaker.org">PasswordMaker</a> on the <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/">stackoverflow</a> podcast, I decided to finally take action. Unlike a lot of other "password manager" applications, PasswordMaker doesn't require you to store your passwords anywhere or synchronize them between machines. Instead, it uses a hash algorithm to generate a unique password for each site, but you don't have to store anything anywhere.  It can be used with any web browser, on any platform.
</p>
<p>
So now I'm changing all my passwords on all the web sites I use. I may even change them periodically.
