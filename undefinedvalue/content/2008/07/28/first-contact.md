Today is the anniversary of the first communication between my wife and myself.  How did we celebrate?  By playing online games on our <i>two</i> Xbox 360 consoles; one in the family room, and one in the bedroom, shouting taunts at one another.

Some may think it's a little sad that we did this, but think about it this way:  what is the likelihood that each of us would have found another person who would have thought this was a great way to spend an evening?

By the way, this is the first time we've played games like this.  And my wife probably won't immediately recognize the Star Trek allusion in this post's title.  She's not <i>that</i> geeky, which is a very good thing.
