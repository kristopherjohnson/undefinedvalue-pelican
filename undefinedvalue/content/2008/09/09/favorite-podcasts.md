If you're like me, you might like the same podcasts I do.  Here are my current favorites.
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://youlooknicetoday.com/">You Look Nice Today: A Journal of Emotional Hygiene</a>: I find this hilarious, although I suspect most people won't get it at all.  It's basically just three guys talking, alternating between being absurd and being abusive toward one another.  The cultural references are primarily geared toward white American males in their 30's and 40's who have never played team sports.  This podcast is not safe for work.</li>
<li><a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a>: This is a series of conversations between Joel&nbsp;Spolsky (the <a href="http://joelonsoftware.com">Joel on&nbsp;Software</a> guy) and Jeff&nbsp;Atwood (the <a href="http://codinghorror.com">Coding&nbsp;Horror</a> guy).  The conversations are centered around development of the new <a href="http://stackoverflow.com">stackoverflow.com</a> programmers' web site, but they follow a lot of diversions into general software development topics.  If you're a software developer, you'll find this podcast very interesting.  If you're not, you won't know what they're talking about.</li>
<li><a href="http://thisamericanlife.org/">This American Life</a>: I've <a href="http://kristopherjohnson.blogspot.com/2008/06/this-american-life.html">written about this before</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.themoth.org/podcast">The Moth Podcast</a>: This podcast consists of people telling stories on stage.  Most are pretty good.  Some aren't.</li>
</ul>
