Another year has gone by.  I didn't really set many goals for myself last year, so I'm not disappointed by any failures (although I am disappointed that I didn't set any goals).  I lost 20 pounds and ran the Peachtree Road Race, but I've regained the 20 pounds.

The biggest change in my life is that the Match.com thing worked out and I am now part of an "us."  This is making me very happy.  We live in a newly-purchased old cabin in the woods.  I'm now spending my weekends doing yardwork and other handiwork, which is a big change from my old lifestyle.  I now have access to a chainsaw and will soon have a tiller.  At some point, I'm going to have to learn about wells so I can get rid of the sulfur smell in our water.

I never understood why all the guys with wives and girlfriends never have any free time to hang out with us unencumbered guys.  Now I understand.  There's not much "me time" anymore, but I don't miss it.  (Love you, sweetie.)

I am practicing guitar whenever I have some free time.  I hope to be able to play some actual music by this time next year.  I also want to master the drums on Rock Band.

I'm going to start taking a self-portrait on each birthday.  I hope my deterioration will be very slow.  I haven't decided yet whether the beard is going to be a permanent part of my appearance.
