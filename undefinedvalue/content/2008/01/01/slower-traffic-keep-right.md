<i>Having driven a few thousand miles over the holidays, I decided I'd like to present the following message to all the drivers of America:
</i>
</p>
<p>
If you are driving in the left lane on an interstate or other multi-lane highway, please check the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Are there cars right behind you, but no cars in front of you?</li>
<li>Are you driving well below the posted speed limit?</li>
<li>Are people passing you on your right side?</li>
<li>Have you been driving dead even with the car to your right?</li>
<li>Are you talking on the phone, eating, fixing your kids' hair, or engaging in any other activity that may distract you?</li>
<li>Is there no possibility that you will pass anyone, ever?</li>
</ul>
<p>
If you answer <i>Yes</i> to any of the above questions, then please get out of the left lane.  You don't belong there.
</p>
<p>
And please, don't speed up when someone tries to pass you.  Highway driving is not a NASCAR-sanctioned event, and you won't lose any Winston Cup points if you let somebody get in front of you.
</p>
