As mentioned in a [recent post](http://undefinedvalue.com/2009/10/09/little-service-converts-files-epub-format), my wife bought me a Sony PRS-500 Reader, and I like it a lot. I've just found out about an upgrade offer: PRS-500 owners can [trade in their readers for discount on a Reader Pocket or Reader Touch](http://www.sonystyle.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/CategoryDisplay?catalogId=10551&storeId=10151&langId=-1&categoryId=8198552921644683012&N=4294953907). The offer expires April 10, 2010.

(Bummer. Turns out that I have a PRS-505, not a PRS-500, so I'm not eligible for the upgrade. So I guess I'll just have to wait for the Apple tablet.)
