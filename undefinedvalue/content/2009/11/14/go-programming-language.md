There's a new programming language out there: [Go](http://golang.org/). There are lots of ways to describe it, but basically it's got Python-esque syntax and C++-esque performance. It's statically typed, but is designed to feel more like a dynamic language. It has garbage collection.

Based on its pedigree, I expect this to be a lot more successful than the various other languages intended to be successors to C++. Play with it while it's still cool, before it starts to suck.

Sorry, Windows programmers, but only Linux and Mac OS X are supported for now. But I'm sure Windows programmers won't mind; to them, "new programming language" means "C# 4.0".
