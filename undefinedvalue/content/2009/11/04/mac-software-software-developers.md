A fellow developer who is getting his first Mac asked me what software he should get. Here is a list of Mac software that I, as a software developer, find useful.

First, let's look at what apps come in the box, at no extra charge:

- Basic contacts, calendar, and email: Address Book, iCal, Mail
- Word processing and text editing: TextEdit (handles text, RTF, and Microsoft Word DOC formats)
- Automation and scripting: Automator, AppleScript Editor, bash, Python
- Scientific and programmer's calculator: Calculator
- Dictionary and thesaurus: Dictionary
- Music and sound recording and editing: GarageBand
- Desktop search: Spotlight
- Instant messaging and video conferencing: iChat
- Basic image processing: iPhoto
- PDF reader and image file viewer: Preview
- Webkit-based web browser: Safari
- Backups: Time Machine
- X Window System: X11
- Command Prompt, telnet, ssh: Terminal

For basic Mac development, Xcode is the standard tool. For iPhone development, Xcode is the _required_ tool. It includes a bunch of other tools (Interface Builder, iPhone Simulator, Instruments, Shark). Download it from [Apple](http://developer.apple.com/iphone/).

If you like something lower level, remember that Mac OS X is UNIX at its heart, so all the typical UNIX and GNU tools are there (`gcc`, `vi`, `make`, etc.).
