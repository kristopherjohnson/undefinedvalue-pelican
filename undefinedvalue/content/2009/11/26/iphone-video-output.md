A common problem for iPhone developers is demonstrating the apps they've developed to others. Showing it on an actual device only works well if you are showing it to one or two people. Showing it in the iPhone Simulator running on a Mac takes a lot of setup, and may not work if the app depends on things you can't do in the simulator.

Fortunately, [The Evil Boss](http://www.theevilboss.com/) shows us how to [enable video output](http://www.theevilboss.com/2009/10/iphone-video-output.html) for an iPhone application, so you can show it running on a TV screen.
