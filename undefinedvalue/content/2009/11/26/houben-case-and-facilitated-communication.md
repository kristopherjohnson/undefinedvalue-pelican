The media has been reporting that a Belgian man who has been in a coma for 23 years is now able to communicate thanks to "assistance" from an aide who holds his hand while he types on a keyboard (or actually, while *they* type on a keyboard).

Here are a couple of good articles about what seems fishy about these claims, and why "facilitated communication" is not taken seriously by most of the scientific community:

- Wired.com: [Reborn Coma Man's Words May Be Bogus](http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2009/11/houben-communication/)
- Science-based Medicine: [Man in Coma 23 Years â€“ Is He Really Conscious?](http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=2838)

And, finally, there is [video of Houben and his "assistant" typing while Houben's eyes are closed](http://www.deredactie.be/cm/vrtnieuws/mediatheek/programmas/terzake/2.7992/2.7993/1.640381). It's amazing that a man so disabled is able to type with one finger with his eyes closed. I can't do it. I wonder how well he would do if the assistant's eyes were closed.
