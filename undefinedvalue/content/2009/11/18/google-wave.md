Thanks to a former co-worker, I got an invite for [Google Wave](http://wave.google.com/).

The biggest problem right now with Google Wave is finding other people to interact with. Chances are that few of your family, friends, or co-workers have access to Wave yet. I've set up a public wave for readers of this blog. If you are a waver, feel free to play with it:

- [Undefined Value wave](https://wave.google.com/wave/#restored:wave:googlewave.com!w%252Bl7GtSGxjA)

(If that link doesn't work, then try entering "with:public undefined value" in the Google Wave search box.)
