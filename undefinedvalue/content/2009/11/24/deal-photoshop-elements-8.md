If you're one of the people (like me) who needs to occasionally do some image editing, but who doesn't want to spend a few hundred bucks on Photoshop, you may want to check out Photoshop Elements 8.

Adobe has a deal on it right now: $20 off the normal price, and a $20 rebate, so that the final price is about $60. See [the Adobe store](http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshopelmac). Deal ends 11/30/2009.
