Computer security expert [Bruce Schneier](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Schneier) has a really nice opinion piece on CNN:

- [Is aviation security mostly for show?](http://www.cnn.com/2009/OPINION/12/29/schneier.air.travel.security.theater/index.html)

One could wonder whether a computer-security expert is qualified to write about aviation security or national security, but what he says makes a lot of sense.

> Despite fearful rhetoric to the contrary, terrorism is not a transcendent threat. A terrorist attack cannot possibly destroy a country's way of life; it's only our reaction to that attack that can do that kind of damage. The more we undermine our own laws, the more we convert our buildings into fortresses, the more we reduce the freedoms and liberties at the foundation of our societies, the more we're doing the terrorists' job for them.
