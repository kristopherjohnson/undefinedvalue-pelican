Last month, I [committed to do a lot of writing](http://undefinedvalue.com/2009/11/01/not-quite-nanowrimo). Let's see how I did.

I was going to write one blog entry per day. I actually did 22 entries during the 30-day month of November. Not 100%, but not too bad.

My other commitment was to get a new iPhone app into the App Store. That didn't work out. I did work on an app, but as it progressed, I came to the conclusion that it wasn't worth finishing. So instead of spending that time working on an app nobody would use, I spent time learning about JavaScript.

So, I didn't really meet either commitment, but I'm OK with that. I don't mind letting myself down.
