A few days ago, I bought a 15-inch MacBook Pro.  For those of you keeping score, that brings the number of Macintoshes in our household to five.  We also have two iPhones and several iPods.  I wish the local Apple Store had some sort of customer loyalty program.

I bought this machine for work.  (My wife will snicker at this statement, but it's true.)  I've been toting a <a href="http://kristopherjohnson.blogspot.com/2006/11/toshiba-tecra-m7-tablet-pc.html">Toshiba tablet</a> with Windows XP to the office for the past couple of years, but with each passing month, I've hated it more.  Most of my development work has been for Linux, and I haven't needed Windows much.  So, I've decided I'll finally ditch PC's for good.

I will have VMWare Fusion running Windows, Linux, and FreeDOS.  For a contract programming gig a couple years ago, I <a href="http://kristopherjohnson.blogspot.com/2006/10/my-next-windows-laptop.html">ran Windows on my 13-inch MacBook with Parallels</a>, and that worked pretty well, so I'm confident that a beefier Mac with VMWare can handle all my Windows needs from now on.

The new Pro is pretty.  For the past few days, I've been preparing it for service by installing all the necessary software.  On Monday, I'll take it to work, but I'll also take my old Toshiba for a few days until I'm sure the new machine can take its place.
