Another birthday has passed.  It has been an eventful year: I got <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/kristopherjohnson/2791535441/">married</a>, and I've become part of a new family.
</p>
<p>
My wife <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/kristopherjohnson/3149067712/">Pebble</a> is the most amazing person I've ever met.  She's smart.  She's kind.  She's giving.  She's forgiving.  Most of all, she's open in a way I thought nobody could be.  Marriage and life aren't always wonderful, but she's a wonderful wife, and I know I've chosen the right partner.  We grow closer every day, and I honestly can't remember what my life was like before I met her.  (I'm pretty sure it sucked.)
</p>
<p>
For my birthday, she bought me the complete collection of <em>Planet of the Apes</em> movies on Blu-ray.  I didn't even ask for it.  How cool is that?
</p>
<p>
My stepson <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/kristopherjohnson/2915112920/">Bailey</a> is about to become ten years old.  Like his mother, his emotions and thoughts are always right at the surface, so I always know where I stand with him.  He is sometimes incredibly cute, and other times he's apparently possessed by Satan, but I know we'll always love one another.  He loves his new grandma and grandpa (my parents), and enjoys spending time with his new cousins (my nieces).
</p>
<p>
We also got a puppy.  He's a Yorkshire Terrier named <em><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/kristopherjohnson/2619799174/">Mouse</a></em>, and he thinks he owns the house.  I believe there is nothing cuter than a Yorkie puppy.
</p>
<p>
Our little cabin in the woods is nice, but we all agree that we'd like more space, and we're all getting tired of driving two hours a day to get to and from our occupations, so we're probably going to be moving closer to Atlanta some time this year.  But we're not in a hurry: we do like our little cabin in the woods.
</p>
<p>
My forties are shaping up to be a lot better than my twenties and thirties were.  Life is good.  (But I occasionally complain about it anyway.)
</p>
<p>
I've done more traveling in the past year than any other.  My wife and I went to Waikiki for our honeymoon, and also visited Pensacola and the Grand Canyon.  I went alone to Australia for three weeks on business, finally putting my passport to use.
</p>
<p>
Career-wise, I'm in a bit of a rut.  I had hoped to do some job searching this year, but with the economy the way it is, I consider myself fortunate to have the contracting gig that I have.  I'll try to acquire some new skills this year.  Maybe next year...
