It's not always easy to be an Apple fanboy: read "[In Nomine Jobs, et Woz, et Spiritus Schiller](http://www.kungfugrippe.com/post/177715198/confessional)" by Merlin Mann

I've installed Snow Leopard on my old 13-inch white Macbook (which I don't use for anything important). I've had no problems with it, but I'm going to wait a month or two before upgrading the Macs that I rely on. I want to wait until Apple releases a patch or two, and I need to let some [dinosaurs](http://bit.ly/1pVXk5) catch up.

Snow Leopard is a nice upgrade which is definitely worth the thirty bucks, but for most users, it doesn't provide any benefits that justify the pain of being an early adopter.

**UPDATE:** Have installed Snow Leopard on my work laptop. No problems, except that my HAL 9000 screensaver doesn't work anymore.
