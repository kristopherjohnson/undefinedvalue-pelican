If you are a [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) user, you should be aware that [voting is open](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/stack-overflow-moderator-voting-now-open/) for a new moderator.

I personally support [Paul Tomblin](http://stackoverflow.com/users/3333/paul-tomblin), who is an all-around cool guy, but I don't think any of the candidates would be a wrong choice.
