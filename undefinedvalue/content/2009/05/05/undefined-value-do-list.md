I'm happy with how the new Undefined Value site compares with the old Blogger-based site. However, I still have some things to do. I'm a compulsive list-maker, so I'll put my list here.

- Update Drupal
- Add syntax coloring for code examples
- Fix the `<pre>` style so that scrollbars are present when needed
- Move old blog content to new blog
- Move Undefined Value to VPS
