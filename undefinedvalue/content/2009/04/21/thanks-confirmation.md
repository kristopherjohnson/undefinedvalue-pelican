I thought the iPhone App Store's review policy was unnecessarily opaque, but Apple tops it with its <a href="http://www.apple.com/downloads/">Apple Downloads</a> submission process:

<blockquote>

This email confirms we have received your submission. Apple reviews all submissions and reserves the right, at its discretion, to omit, edit, or reject submissions for inclusion on the Mac OS X Downloads website at:
 
<a href="http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/">&lt;http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/&gt;.</a>
 
This is the only notification you will receive. If you do not see your product listed on Mac OS X Downloads after 90 days, you may resubmit it for consideration.

</blockquote>

89 days to go...

<strong>Update:</strong> It only took one day. <em>Menubar Countdown</em> is now available at &lt;<a href="http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/productivity_tools/menubarcountdown.html">http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/productivity_tools/menubarcountdown.html</a>&gt;.
