I've been thinking a lot about what I want _Undefined Value_ to be. These are the reasons I have this blog:

- I enjoy writing and I like to practice.
- I want to make contact with other people who care about the things I care about.
- I want to be able to go back and review what I was thinking in the past.
- For potential clients and employers, I want to have a collection of writings that demonstrate that I'm smart and that I take my work very seriously.
- I want to exercise my rudimentary website design and administration skills.

I don't expect to become a top blogger or generate ad revenue or become an influential thought leader. However, I do want people to read what I write, so I want to attract readers and keep the quality high.

To that end, I have decided to narrow the focus of this blog. Up to now, I think the audience of _Undefined Value_ has consisted of these segments:

1. Software developers
2. People who are not software developers, but who are interested in software and information technology
3. Private pilots
4. Friends and family

Going forward, I'm going to concentrate on the first two groups. I haven't flown for a couple of years, so I don't have much to say to pilots anymore. The friends and family can be served via [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=552697319&ref=name) or my [personal website](http://kristopherjohnson.net/).

That doesn't mean I won't occasionally post a picture of my dogs or re-tell a good fart joke I overheard. It just means that I'm going to focus on things that are of interest to "technology people."

I want to be both a teacher and a learner, so I'll be posting articles that share what I've learned but which also invite commentary.

Thanks for reading, and let me know what you want me to write about.
