For the last five years, http://kristopherjohnson.blogspot.com/ has been the home of my blog, _Undefined&nbsp;Value_.  Blogspot is a great free platform for bloggers to get their feet wet, but I've decided I want to have a "real blog" on a website I control, so _Undefined&nbsp;Value_ now lives at http://undefinedvalue.com/.

I intend to get more serious about blogging. We'll see how that goes.

I'm going to try to get all the content from from the old blog moved over here.  Again, we'll see how that goes.

Thanks to everyone who has read and commented on my blog over the years, and I hope you enjoy the new look. Feel free to leave feedback about the new site. I'm sure I've configured some things incorrectly, so if you have trouble navigating or leaving comments or doing anything else that you should be able to do on a "real blog," I really do want to know about it.
