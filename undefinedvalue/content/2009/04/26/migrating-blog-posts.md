I looked around for an easy way to migrate all the content from my old blog to this new one. While some automated solutions for moving from Blogger to Drupal are available, I decided it would be better to do it all by hand. This gives me a chance to pick only the Best of Undefined Value, and to do some editing.

It's not really that hard.  Just click the edit button for the old post, select all, copy, click my "Create Story" bookmark, paste.

The only tedious part is setting the date. The old site has dates in MM/DD/YYYY HH:MM:SS AM/PM format, whereas Drupal wants YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS, so I can't just copy and paste.

Luckily, there's not much good stuff on the old site, so I hope to have the **Monthly archive** block on the left filled in a few weeks.
