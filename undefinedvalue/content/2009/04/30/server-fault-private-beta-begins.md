[Server Fault](http://serverfault.com) is a new Q&A website for system administrators and IT professionals, brought to us by the folks who brought us [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/).

It just started its private beta, which is open to any Stack Overflow user with a reputation score of 100 or higher, or anyone with an OpenID who submits a request.  See the [Stack Overflow blog entry](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/04/server-fault-private-beta-begins/) for details.

I'm in the process of setting up an Ubuntu web server on a Xen VPS, so I expect to have a lot of questions to post on Server Fault. It arrived at the perfect time.
