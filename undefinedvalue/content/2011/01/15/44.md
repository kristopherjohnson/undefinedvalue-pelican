Another year past. Highlights of the past year:

We've acquired two more dogs this year: "Blitz," a Miniature Schnauzer, and "Lucy," one of a litter of puppies from our Yorkies Boo and Tweezer. This brings the total to five. We gave away four puppies from two litters this year. One puppy, "Riley," ended up with my parents, and the other three were taken by Bailey's soccer coach. 

Stopped working for Scientific Games as a contractor, and returned to TransCore as a contractor. 

My wife Pebble went through a couple of surgeries in the space of a few weeks this summer, so that was tough on her, but she's doing well now. 

Bsiley started middle school. He has taken up the oboe. I'm happy to hear him practicing it. It's the first thing he's taken any interest in other than videogames, and it's nice to seem him excited about it. 

I've gained back ten of the thirty pounds that I lost in 2009. So I'm working on that again. 

I don't know what's in store for me this year. I may be offered permanent employment with TransCore. I may start an MBA program in the fall. I'm sure there will be surprises and setbacks. 

Anyway, enough for now. It's time for the hourly dog-poop removal.
